                Technical Areas of Interest
            </h2>
                <p>
                    My Technical Areas of Interest are cloud engineering, distributed systems, data analysis, statistics, and computer graphics.
                    This summer, I did an internship on the cloud platform engineering team where I worked on the Kubernetes clusters the team is currently rolling out to every CarMax store in the nation.
                    Each Kubernetes cluster would contain all the packaged applications an in-store team would need to sell cars. I really enjoyed working with the cloud because it was really interesting that
                    I could write software and policies, push my changes onto the cluster, and then help thousands of in-store associates as a result. Moreover, I enjoy the field of data analysis and statistics.
                    My introduction to this field was through the AP Statistics class in high school. Since then, I've added a statistics minor in college at Texas A&M University and taken several higher-level statistics courses.
                    I'm interested in this subject because I enjoy organizing vast amounts of data in a meaningful way that helps us to generate information that can be greatly useful for any business. Specifically,
                    I like learning about trends in population and demographic data, and I think data analysis is a field in which I would love to do research.  
                    Additionally, I enjoy distrubuted system because I love the complexity of the problems that arise when many computers are involved in a system. In today's society, the number of computer users is at an all time high 
                    and will definitely continue to increase rapidly. As a result, we need to be able to handle increasingly large amounts of user data and and resources - a growing problem with a solution that I would love to contribute to
                    finding in the future. Finally, computer graphics is interesting to me because I've always been a very creative and art-oriented person. Digital illustration and photography are my biggest hobbies, and as a Computer Scientist
                    I want to be able to create advanced graphics that contribute to a beautiful user experience.
